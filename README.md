## Lessons Learned

- To check if baking soda is still good for baking purposes, combine a small spoonful with a bit of vinegar. If it fizzes like crazy, it's good to use.
- Always wash blueberries/fruit before using and be sure to check for mold (sneaky mold at the bottom of a container can ruin a morning of pancake making).
