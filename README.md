A pancake recipe I'm trying to perfect. Originally taken [from here](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/).

## Goals

- Make the recipe liquid enough to be able to easily use my [pancake batter dispenser](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=31&ved=2ahUKEwjB1rDQ9PnnAhWpHjQIHY5pCykQFjAeegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPancake-Cupcake-Batter-Dispenser-KPKitchen%2Fdp%2FB00R48FNTE&usg=AOvVaw0rVHbNiQsagxs5F0kDy-Mt)

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons butter, melted

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.
1. Heat a griddle to 325 degrees. Pour the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook for 2 minutes on each side.
1. Serve with butter and syrup.
