- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1+ cup fresh blueberries

## Directions

1. Mix the milk and vinegar and let sit for a minute or two (you're making "buttermilk")
1. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl
1. Add the egg, milk, and melted butter to the bowl and mix until combined
1. Heat your skillet to 350 degrees
1. Pour 1/3 cup of batter onto the hot skillet, arrange a few blueberries on top, and cook for 2 minutes on each side
